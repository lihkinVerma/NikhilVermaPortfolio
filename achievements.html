	<h3>Top Gun Award (Special Mention)</h3>
	<div class="box">
		<p>
			I worked on parsing resumes from email responses which had challenges of data analysis/feature reduction/clustering. It was a design on a heuristic-based model with a data analysis pipeline where SOTA clustering algorithm was used on a real dataset. Unlike ML-based parser this email parser is a static heuristic parser, constructed using pattern recognition, so its accuracy is 100%. As an impact, this feature has helped to increase the coverage as emails make more than 15% of total responses coming to a system that used to be ignored earlier.

	<h3>Popular Stall Award</h3>
	<div class="box">
		<p>In 2020, InfoEdge hold a virtual Hackathon with the participation of more than 80 teams. Our idea was to make a Personalized email generator that could craft emails analyzing Job and Candidate profiles. We used Candidate Recommender Engine and NLP distance metrics to calculate the matching of entities. Our project showcasing attracted huge viewer participation and we are now in process of implementing this project for our Live Audience.</p>

	<h3>Collaboration and Ownership Award</h3>
	<div class="box">
		<p>Teams across Data Science(DS), Engineering(Tech), Product(Prod), and Operations(Ops) got together to build a scalable deep learning(DL) solution. Ops stepped up to tag CVs for creating training data. DS and Prod collaborated with Ops to define manual entity extraction process along with an annotation portal to create ground truth. Using this data, DS developed the core solution - 11+ DL modules that achieved 20%+ improvement. RMS Tech team engineered micro-services oriented parallel architecture for making horizontally scalable Parser, otherwise restricted to 50 clients. Tech team also innovated a solution that enable CVâ€™s HTML conversion, and tagging of HTML CVs for Ops, tackling semantic concept limitation. Award given for working in such diverse environment of team members having expertise in their own field of ownership</p>
