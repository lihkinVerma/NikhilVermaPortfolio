		When we think of an achievement, we tend to picture something out of the ordinary, like exceeding targets,
		landing a big sale, or delivering a project milestone.
		<br>
		But other, less measurable, behaviors deserve recognition, too – for example, pulling together as a team to head off an
		important project, learning and applying a new skill, or mentoring others at work.
		Even something as simple as quietly consistent good work can be worthy of celebration.
	</p>
	<h4>I celebrate the achievements with full shout out</h4>
	<p align="justify">
		I don't forget to mention my own accomplishments!
		<br>
		I gives me time to think about what I've achieved as part of my personal goal setting.
		This boost my self-esteem, and sense of autonomy and mastery. It also increases my visibility, particularly if share
		the credit with others as my team mates or my mentor.

	<h3>Top Gun Award (Special Mention)</h3>
	<div class="box">
		<p align="justify">
			I worked on parsing resumes from email responses which had challenges of data analysis/feature reduction/clustering.
			It was a design on a heuristic-based model with a data analysis pipeline where SOTA clustering algorithm was used on
			a real dataset. Unlike ML-based parser this email parser is a static heuristic parser, constructed using pattern recognition,
			so its accuracy is 100%. As an impact, this feature has helped to increase the coverage as emails make more than 15% of
			total responses coming to a system that used to be ignored earlier.

	<h3>Popular Stall Award</h3>
	<div class="box">
		<p align="justify">In 2020, InfoEdge hold a virtual Hackathon with the participation of more than 80 teams.
			Our idea was to make a Personalized email generator that could craft emails analyzing Job and Candidate profiles.
			We used Candidate Recommender Engine and NLP distance metrics to calculate the matching of entities.
			Our project showcasing attracted huge viewer participation and we are now in process of implementing this project
			for our Live Audience.</p>

	<h3>Collaboration and Ownership Award</h3>
	<div class="box">
		<p align="justify">
			Teams across Data Science(DS), Engineering(Tech), Product(Prod), and Operations(Ops) got together to build a scalable
			deep learning(DL) solution. Ops stepped up to tag CVs for creating training data. DS and Prod collaborated with
			Ops to define manual entity extraction process along with an annotation portal to create ground truth.
			Using this data, DS developed the core solution - 11+ DL modules that achieved 20%+ improvement. RMS Tech team engineered
			micro-services oriented parallel architecture for making horizontally scalable Parser, otherwise restricted to 50 clients.
			Tech team also innovated a solution that enable CV’s HTML conversion, and tagging of HTML CVs for Ops, tackling semantic
			concept limitation. Award given for working in such diverse environment of team members having expertise in their
			own field of ownership

	<h3>Top Gun Award</h3>
	<div class="box">
		<p align="justify">
			Awarded for creating a framework for efficient execution of deep learning models and laying down parallel architecture
			for running Prediction-As-A-Service based service-oriented architecture. Top Gun Award which are Quarterly
			appreciation awards across the Info Edge. Rarely one or two engineers are selected per quarter for their outstanding work.
			In the annual appraisal review process of the company, I got an Outstanding rating as I performed consistently
			exceptionally as compared to the performance standard set for the peer group.

	<h3>Merit scholarship</h3>
	<div class="box">
		<p align="justify">
			Thrice merit scholarship (TIET) winner from Aug 2016 - July 2019
			Top 10% of the overall student strength use to get a scholarship waiving 25% of tuition fees for an academic year.
			I also stood among top 3 position holders in the branch of Computer science attributing to which I received this scholarship
			for almost full stay at the university campus during my bachelor's study.

	<h3>Smart India Hackathon</h3>
	<div class="box">
		<p align="justify">
			I participated in Smart India Hackathon 2019 which is a nationwide initiative to provide students a platform to solve
			some of pressing problems we face in our daily lives, and thus inculcate a culture of product innovation and a mindset
			of problem solving. As part of this event, I worked in a team from Thapar University on a real life problem faced
			by Golf Community and provided a solution using Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision, in a time span of 36 Hours.
			Our team won this competition.
