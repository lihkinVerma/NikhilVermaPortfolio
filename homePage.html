        <p align="justify"> Interdisciplinary nature of the art of finding regularities in data is both fascinating and
            meaningful to me, as it gives me wings to collaborate across teams and innovate techniques
            unheard-of. Drug potency prediction, occluded face recognition, web template clustering and
            applying OCR in action is the range of fields I have explored in the past. With the latest
            hands-on to develop Resume parser for business use, I devised a responsive parallelization-based
            architecture to put NLP systems in production.</p>
        <p align="justify"> Data Science is an evolving field with fastly changing state-of-the-art benchmarks.
            Besides being academically competent, I believe uncommon results can be achieved if we could channelize
            individual brilliance via team-spirit. With this mindset lets join hands to create new milestones in deep learning research while
            working across continents, impacting masses by work and exploring big datasets.</p>

                <p align="justify">Deep learning models are both computation and time intensive in nature.
                    I built a parallelization based architecture, that could couple
                    the time requirement of various sections, with no loss in output generated to parse a CV.</p></div>

                    templates on an eCommerce website from millions of web pages. I designed a pipeline to cluster
                    web pages and obtain clubbed data points together.</p></div>

                    machine learning techniques were applied to propose a multi-level scheme for classification of drugs providing
                    cellular defence against oxidative stress in human body.</p></div>

                    present day situations, an interfacing of C++ code was created to build a Pythonic tool for use.</p></div>

            <h3>Alpine for Python Docker Images</h3>
            <p align="justify">When you’re choosing a base image for your Docker image, Alpine Linux is often recommended due to the benefits it comes with; Small. Simple. Secure.
                But make sure that alpine makes Python Docker builds way too(50×) slower, and images double(2×) larger</p>

            <h3>Long Term Dependencies in Sequence Learning</h3>
            <p align="justify">Gradients propagated over many stages tend to either vanish (most of the time) or explode
                (damaging optimization). The difficulty with long-term dependencies arise from exponentially smaller weights
                given to long-term interactions (involving multiplication of many Jacobians).</p>

            <h3>Oxy-crisis: Solving via Twitter and Instagram data collection</h3>
            <p align="justify">The new variants of Wuhan Virus are spreading out rapidly and infecting larger populations in countries
                of scale like India, Brazil, US and nearly all nations. Amid the pandemic, supplies of oxygen to patients is creating
                panic in both public & medical infrastructure and are hot topic of discussion in quasi-fedral government’s discussions.</p>

            <h3>Moving Monoliths to MicroServices</h3>
            <p align="justify">A monolithic architecture is the traditional unified model for the design of a software program.
                A microservice architectural style is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services,
                each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API.</p>
