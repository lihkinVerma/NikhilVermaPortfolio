        <p align="justify"> The interdisciplinary nature of the art of finding regularities in the data is
            both fascinating and meaningful to me, as it gives me wings to collaborate across the teams and
            innovate techniques unheard-of. Drug potency prediction, Occluded face recognition, Web template
            clustering and applying the OCR in action are the range of fields I have explored in the past. With the
            latest hands-on to develop a Resume parser for the business use, I devised a responsive parallelization-based
            architecture to put the NLP system in production.</p>

        <p align="justify"> Machine Learning is interesting because developing our understanding of machine learning entails
            developing our understanding of the principles that underlie intelligence. Data Science is an evolving field
            with fastly changing state-of-the-art benchmarks. Beside being academically competent, I believe in this
            agile environment uncommon results can be achieved if we could
            channelize individual brilliance via team-spirit. With this mindset let's join hands to create
            new milestones in deep learning research while working across the continents, impacting masses by
            work and exploring big datasets.</p>

                <p align="justify">Deep learning models are both computation and time intensive in nature.
                    I built a parallelization based architecture, that could couple
                    the time requirement of various sections, with no loss in output generated to parse a CV.</p></div>

                    templates on an eCommerce website from millions of web pages. I designed a pipeline to cluster
                    web pages and obtain clubbed data points together.</p></div>

            <h3>Alpine for Python Docker Images</h3>
            <p align="justify">When you’re choosing a base image for your Docker image, Alpine Linux is often recommended due to the benefits it comes with; Small. Simple. Secure.
                But make sure that alpine makes Python Docker builds way too(50×) slower, and images double(2×) larger</p>

            <h3>Components of Transformer Architecture</h3>
            <p align="justify">Dependency modelling without considering input or output sequences deal with the problem
                of model forgetting long-range dependencies that attention mechanism leverages. Neural sequence
                transduction model — Transformer introduced in 2017 is entirely built on self-attention mechanism
                without using sequence aligned recurrent architecture. Let's briefly talk about its components.</p>

            <h3>Ensuring Fairness in Machine Learning to Advance Health Equity</h3>
            <p align="justify">Health domain has witnessed an increase in use of machine learning (ML) technology
                which follows the saying “garbage in garbage out”. Factors such as human and structural
                biases at various stages of data collection, model design and prediction interpretation have
                all accounted for widening the gap of health disparity among protective groups.</p>

            <h3>Long Term Dependencies in Sequence Learning</h3>
            <p align="justify">Gradients propagated over many stages tend to either vanish (most of the time) or explode
                (damaging optimization). The difficulty with long-term dependencies arise from exponentially smaller weights
                given to long-term interactions (involving multiplication of many Jacobians).</p>

            <h3>Oxy-crisis: Solving via Twitter and Instagram data collection</h3>
            <p align="justify">The new variants of Wuhan Virus are spreading out rapidly and infecting larger populations in countries
                of scale like India, Brazil, US and nearly all nations. Amid the pandemic, supplies of oxygen to patients is creating
                panic in both public & medical infrastructure and are hot topic of discussion in quasi-fedral government’s discussions.</p>

            <h3>Moving Monoliths to MicroServices</h3>
            <p align="justify">A monolithic architecture is the traditional unified model for the design of a software program.
                A microservice architectural style is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services,
                each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API.</p>
