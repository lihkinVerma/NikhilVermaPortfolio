	<!--h2>Master of Science in Applied Computing - Data Science</h2>
	<p><b>University</b>: University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada</p>
	<p><b>Duration</b>: Starting this fall till end of 2022</p>
	<p align="justify">
		I am going to join UofT, a dream school of mine to pursue my higher studies in field of Data Science.
		My inspiration to choose this university was Prof. Geoffrey Everest Hinton who has been most noted for his work on artificial neural networks.
		He is often called the "Father of Deep Learning".
		Unlike many, UofT was the only university I was targeting and luckily I got selected for the MScAC program which is a mix of both
		academic classes and research internship.

	<p align="justify">
		ACM India body every year arranges summer school and offer self-motivated students in-depth knowledge and exposure to
		research in advanced technology areas. Each school covers academic and applied research, and is taught by the best-in-class
		faculty from academia as well as industry. During 2018, ACM India and Microsoft jointly organised a school on data science and
		selected roughly 47 students across the country(India) to teach students the basics of the subject. This was a chance for me
		to learn from the best professors in my country in the field. Based on my performance, I was then invited to Microsoft-ACM
		Academic Research Summit 2019 held at IIT Madras.
