        In humans, oxidative stress is involved in the development of diabetes, cancer, hypertension, Alzheimers’ disease, and heart failure. One of the mechanisms in the cellular defence against oxidative stress is the activation of the Nrf2-antioxidant response element (ARE) signalling pathway. Computation of activity, efficacy, and potency score of ARE signalling pathway and to propose a multi-level prediction scheme for the same is the main aim of the study as it contributes in a big amount to the improvement of oxidative stress in humans. Applying the process of knowledge discovery from data, required knowledge is gathered and then machine learning techniques are applied to propose a multi-level scheme. The validation of the proposed scheme is done using the K-fold cross-validation method and an accuracy of 90% is achieved for prediction of activity score for ARE molecules which determine their power to refine oxidative stress.

        Recruiters can easily shortlist candidates for jobs via viewing their curriculum vitae (CV) document. Unstructured document CV beholds candidate’s portfolio and named entities listing details. The main aim of this study was to design and propose a web oriented, highly responsive, computational pipeline that systematically predicts CV entities using hierarchically-refined label attention networks. Deep learning models specialized for named entity recognition were trained on large dataset to predict relevant fields. The article suggests an optimal strategy to use a number of deep learning models in parallel and predict in real time. We demonstrated selection of light weight micro web framework using Analytical Hierarchy Processing algorithm and focus on an approach useful to deploy large deep learning model-based pipelines in production ready environments using microservices. Response time for parser was impressively 700 milliseconds for sequential flow of requests.
