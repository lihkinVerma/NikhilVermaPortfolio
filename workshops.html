		Technical workshop plays a very important role for every Engineering student. Participating in
		Technical workshops shows an avid behaviour of student towards process of learning despite the preset curricula.
		It serves like adding salt and pepper for working capabilities.
		The most basic ingredient that identifies one as an engineer is the knowledge in the field of study. Attending workshops is
		an easy way of skimming many research articles and listening from the field experts. With that comes the power of asking question
		and instead of waiting for a reply in your mail box, your doubt get resolved immediately by the subject expert.

	<p align="justify">
		I had participated, coordinated and delivered in college level workshops as an attendee, coordinator and as a subject expert.
		My field of talk majorly remains Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing or API development using web frameworks.
		<br>
		I love to connect to students as well for majorly two reasons:-
		<br>
		1. I could image myself better in shoes of students, since I am a recent graduate myself.
		<br>
		2. Teaching is a better way of Learning since you explore the topic from all perspectives.
