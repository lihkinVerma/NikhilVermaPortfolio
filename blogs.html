	<h4>Why I think writing is important in era of video streaming apps?</h4>
	<p align="justify">
        We hear so much these days about how video is taking over the internet.
        People have shorter attention spans, and most of us would prefer to watch a video than to read written text.
        And that's exactly my concern, reading and writing involve more cognitive ability of humans compared to video.
        Your blog is the place where you can express and test ideas and refine your message before you commit those ideas to text.
    </p>

    <h4>What do I read and write?</h4>
	<p align="justify">
        Most of my reading is academic but apart from that I guess I like Non-fiction. "Connect the dots", "The power of HABITS",
        "Storyworthy", "Factfulness", "Light from many lamps", "Ignited Minds", "The white Tiger" are some of names coming to my mind.
        <br>
        Interesting is that I write as well. Most of my writings are technical blogs about day-to-day small experiments or projects I do.
        In case I come across some (new to me) tech/algo, I try to document it with me for rest of the time. At times, I convert the lectures
        that I take at some workshops, to storyworthy notes. You could catch my writings at my medium handle

            <h3>Multi Processing in Python</h3>
            <p align="justify">The multiprocessing library uses separate memory space, multiple CPU cores, bypasses GIL
                limitations in CPython, child processes are kill able(ex. function calls in program) and is much easier to use. In this article I
                compare two ways of implemeting multiprocessing via Process or via Pool</p>

            <h3>Lets chat with Telegram Bot</h3>
            <p align="justify">With the advent of social world, we are living with so many chatting apps and blogging
                sites where at time, we our self don't know; who we are talking to. Is that really my friend or a bot mimicking him.
                In this article I explain how to create a telegram bot.</p>

            <h3>Components of Transformer Architecture</h3>
            <p align="justify">Dependency modelling without considering input or output sequences deal with the problem
                of model forgetting long-range dependencies that attention mechanism leverages. Neural sequence
                transduction model — Transformer introduced in 2017 is entirely built on self-attention mechanism
                without using sequence aligned recurrent architecture. Let's briefly talk about its components.</p>

            <h3>Ensuring Fairness in Machine Learning to Advance Health Equity</h3>
            <p align="justify">Health domain has witnessed an increase in use of machine learning (ML) technology
                which follows the saying “garbage in garbage out”. Factors such as human and structural
                biases at various stages of data collection, model design and prediction interpretation have
                all accounted for widening the gap of health disparity among protective groups.</p>

            <h3>Alpine for Python Docker Images</h3>
            <p align="justify">When you’re choosing a base image for your Docker image, Alpine Linux is often recommended due to the benefits it comes with; Small. Simple. Secure.
                But make sure that alpine makes Python Docker builds way too(50×) slower, and images double(2×) larger</p>

            <h3>Long Term Dependencies in Sequence Learning</h3>
            <p align="justify">Gradients propagated over many stages tend to either vanish (most of the time) or explode
                (damaging optimization). The difficulty with long-term dependencies arise from exponentially smaller weights
                given to long-term interactions (involving multiplication of many Jacobians).</p>

            <h3>Oxy-crisis: Solving via Twitter and Instagram data collection</h3>
            <p align="justify">The new variants of Wuhan Virus are spreading out rapidly and infecting larger populations in countries
                of scale like India, Brazil, US and nearly all nations. Amid the pandemic, supplies of oxygen to patients is creating
                panic in both public & medical infrastructure and are hot topic of discussion in quasi-fedral government’s discussions.</p>

            <h3>Moving Monoliths to MicroServices</h3>
            <p align="justify">A monolithic architecture is the traditional unified model for the design of a software program.
                A microservice architectural style is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services,
                each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API.</p>
