		I absolutely love what I do, and I’m lucky to be able to make a living at it. But, that doesn’t mean that I’m not consciously aware of the fact that I would usually rather be enjoying cocktails with friends than trying to meet a deadline.
		<br>
		Work requires exertion and effort in order to pay the bills and put food on the table. If you’re lucky, you’ll be able to incorporate  joy and passion into your daily routine. But, that definitely doesn’t mean that your entire career will be a walk in the park.
	</p>
	<h3>What I love doing at work?</h3>
	<p align="justify">
		By degree and present designation, I am a "Senior Software Developer" but that do not define me holistically.
		I love to convert monoliths to REST based micro-services, learn about various databases [SQL-NoSQL] and see my code going to production.
		I experiment in my working hours with neural network architectures, Deep learning model training, tweaking the parameters & observe changes
		and note them to derive meaningful insights out of them.
		<br>
		More than anything else I love to learn new tech at my work.
	</p>
	<h3>What motivates me to work?</h3>
