		I absolutely love what I do, and I’m lucky to be able to make a living at it. But, that doesn’t mean that I’m not consciously aware of the fact that I would usually rather be enjoying cocktails with friends than trying to meet a deadline.
		<br>
		Work requires exertion and effort in order to pay the bills and put food on the table. If you’re lucky, you’ll be able to incorporate  joy and passion into your daily routine. But, that definitely doesn’t mean that your entire career will be a walk in the park.
	</p>
	<h3>What I love doing at work?</h3>
	<p align="justify">
		By degree and present designation, I am a "Senior Software Developer" but that do not define me holistically.
		I love to convert monoliths to REST based micro-services, learn about various databases [SQL-NoSQL] and see my code going to production.
		I experiment in my working hours with neural network architectures, Deep learning model training, tweaking the parameters & observe changes
		and note them to derive meaningful insights out of them.
		<br>
		More than anything else I love to learn new tech at my work.
	</p>
	<h3>What motivates me to work?</h3>
	<p align="justify">
		Following are some of the activities that motive me the most:-
		<ul>
			<li>Concern for meeting internal and external customer needs in a manner that provides delight to the customer</li>
			<li>Plans, analyzes and problem solving for efficient and effective execution</li>
			<li>Work acts as Food to the entrepreneurial mindset within the realms of the organization.</li>
			<li>Presents information to others in an understandable form, ensuring that others comprehend the message</li>
		</ul>

		<li> Diffusion idea exploration for industrial applications</li>
		<li> Diffusion is a fascinating story of expedition from random dots to images. 
			Diffusion Models(DMs) are quiet popular since past some time as the quality of generated images 
			is simply amazing beating other generative models such as GANs, VAEs and Autoregressive models. 
			But the bottle neck of using DM, the sampling speed aka inference time to produce samples is worth considering. 
			Dealing with the same and producing more high quality images, Stability AI company came up with the idea of 
			Latent Diffusion Model which was accepted in CVPR conference 2022 and later the pre-trained model weights were 
			released to public for constructive purposes. During this internship I accomplished Diffusion idea exploration 
			for industrial applications. Attached is list of medium blogs I wrote during the tenure of my internship:-</li>
