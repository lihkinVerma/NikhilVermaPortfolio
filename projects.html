	<h3>Are Projects really important?</h3>
	<p align="justify">
		Projects are common in university teaching and corporate cultures, but they are different from the types of academic study that students experience regularly.
		Most of us are more used to learning about a particular subject or skill, with teaching that is designed to help you understand
		this subject in a very guided way. However, a project encourages you to make decisions about the direction to take, and to
		work independently.

	<h2>Web-template clustering for data analysis</h2>
	<p align="justify">
		With the boom in the IT industry, usage of WWW has made a blast on the internet.
		Although the number of web pages increase exponentially on websites like Amazon, Myntra and other ecommerce sites,
		with each passing unit of time, the underlying pages actually made by a front-end engineer are very limited.
		<br>
		These once-designed pages are what are known as Web Templates and are core of some businesses who sell such templates even.
		Using clustering techniques of machine learning I tried to automatically extract the unique underlying
		templates on an eCommerce website from millions of web pages.
		<br>
		<ol>
			At a high level, the pipeline:-
			<li>First extracts features of interest from pages that are crawled.</li>
			<li>Feature cleaning is then performed to improve clustering quality.</li>
			<li>The cleaned features are clustered to determine sets of pages with a similar structure.</li>
		</ol>

	<h2>Delivered End-to-End CV-Parser using NLP</h2>
	<p align="justify">
		Hiring candidates for jobs is an area in which companies are shifting to green human resource
		management (HRM) practices which are free from consequences of influences and societal biases
		using deep learning technologies.
		<br>
		Converting unstructured textual Curriculum Vitae(CV) into structured data makes it useful at many places as in
		Applicant Tracking System (ATS), Applicant Ranking System (ARS) or CV recommender engines.
	</p>
	<p align="justify">
		Using state-of-the-art bert architecture I performed NER(named entity recognition) using Hierarichally Refined Label
		Attention Network(HLAN) architecture. I tried to train 50000 manually labelled Resumes and layed a parallel system of
		microservices using one of the lighweight micro web-framework chosed via comparing load testing results
		through Analytical hierarchy processing.
		<br>
		I was awarded Top Gun Award for completing this project and also the proposed architecture
		is in presently submitted to a journal for peer review process.

	<h2>Single Sign On(SSO) Integration</h2>
	<p align="justify">
		Don’t you ever wonder, how could you login to some web-site using credentials of some other 3rd party site?
		Take the case of medium blogging site, most of us do not care to create a new email-id to get logged in.
		It's just our gmail or fb account that helped us break that layer of authentication and enter into website.
		<br>
		Single sign-on (SSO) is a property of access control of multiple related, yet independent, software systems.
		A user logs in with a single ID and password to gain access to any of several related systems.
		SSO shares centralized authentication servers.
		<br>
		I tried to implement this feature for the product "Referral", which I was working for.

	<h2>Python Interface using SWIG generator</h2>
	<p align="justify">
		Python is a gluing language. It is very good at connecting software that were not originally meant to work directly
		with each other. For “faster” languages like C, this type of glue work is so painfully slow and error prone to code
		it is hardly even worth the effort. Any gains in execution speed are more than offset by the amount of wasted developer
		time spent getting it to work. That is one huge reason Python continues to be so popular.
	</p>
	<p align="justify">
		Simplified Wrapper & Interface Generator(SWIG) is a compiler that turns ANSI C/C++ declarations into scripting language
		interfaces. Siemens works in static design verification domain using cdc/formal technologies, and there have been
		request from customers(ARM) to have python shell for their tool. Using SWIG interfacing, I tried to build a Python tool for "Questa
		static tool", a product of Siemens(MentorGraphics).

	<h2>Automatic handwriting analyzer</h2>
	<p align="justify">
		Intelligent Handwriting Character Recognition is one of the field left very less touched and worked upon.
		Various OCR engines work for English language but that too not handwritten.
		The aim of this project was the processing of Handwritten images and extract something meaningful out of it.
		The stepwise approach followed was:-
		<ol>
			<li> Line-word segmentation from any given input image</li>
			<li> Character segmentation from any gven input image</li>
			<li> ML dataset of EMNIST conversion from format available into csv files</li>
			<li> Building CNN model using EMNIST dataset</li>
			<li> Testing the model on test dataset to find accuracy</li>
			<li> Comparator of segmented characters to find similar images</li>
			<li> OCR and Audio analysis to convert any input text image and produce audio of same</li>
		</ol>

	<h2>Classification of drug molecules</h2>
	<p align="justify">
        In humans, oxidative stress is involved in the development of diabetes, cancer, hypertension, Alzheimers’ disease, and heart failure. One of the mechanisms in the cellular defence against oxidative stress is the activation of the Nrf2-antioxidant response element (ARE) signalling pathway. Computation of activity, efficacy, and potency score of ARE signalling pathway and to propose a multi-level prediction scheme for the same is the main aim of the study as it contributes in a big amount to the improvement of oxidative stress in humans. Applying the process of knowledge discovery from data, required knowledge is gathered and then machine learning techniques are applied to propose a multi-level scheme. The validation of the proposed scheme is done using the K-fold cross-validation method and an accuracy of 90% is achieved for prediction of activity score for ARE molecules which determine their power to refine oxidative stress.
